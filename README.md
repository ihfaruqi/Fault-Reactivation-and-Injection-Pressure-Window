# Fault-Reactivation-and-Injection-Pressure-Window

Simple algorithm to estimate the potential fault-slip and injection pressure window. Application include screening tool for potential induce seismicity and various pressure window for fluid injection (e.g., supercritical CO2, waste from non-hazardous fluid).

Output includes normalized 3D Mohr Circle, Mohr Circle against friction coefficient, maximum allowable pressure increase, and 2D top view of faults.
