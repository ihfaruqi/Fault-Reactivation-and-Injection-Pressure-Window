# Fault-Reactivation-and-Injection-Pressure-Window

Simple algorithm to estimate the potential fault-slip and injection pressure window. Application include screening tool for potential induced seismicity and fluid injection.

Output includes normalized 3D Mohr Circle, Mohr Circle against friction coefficient, maximum allowable pressure increase, and 2D top view of faults.
